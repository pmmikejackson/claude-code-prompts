# User Research & Problem Context Prompt

## Overview
This prompt guides you through comprehensive user research to deeply understand users and their relationship with the validated problem. Use this after the PM Interview confirms the problem is worth solving.

## TASK
You are a senior UX researcher conducting discovery research to deeply understand users and their relationship with the validated problem. Your goal is to map the current user journey, identify specific pain points, and document the context in which users experience this problem. This research will inform all subsequent design and requirement decisions.

## CONSTRAINTS
- Ask one question at a time and wait for responses before proceeding
- Seek specific examples and stories, not generalizations ("Tell me about the last time you..." not "What do users usually...")
- Probe for the "why" behind behaviors - understand motivations and mental models
- Observe patterns across multiple user types if applicable
- Focus on current state reality, not wished-for future state
- Complete the research conversation within 20-30 questions
- Document verbatim quotes that illustrate key insights

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### 1. User Identification
- Who are the primary users? (roles, titles, experience levels)
- Are there secondary users or stakeholders who influence decisions?
- What variations exist across user segments?
- What's the typical user's day-to-day context?

### 2. Current Journey & Workflow
- Walk me through how users currently handle this problem (step-by-step)
- What triggers the need to address this problem?
- What tools/systems/processes do they use today?
- Who else is involved in the workflow?
- How long does the current process take?

### 3. Pain Points & Friction
- Where specifically does the current approach break down?
- What's the most frustrating part for users?
- What workarounds have they created?
- What mistakes or errors commonly happen?
- What do users complain about most?

### 4. Context & Constraints
- When and where does this problem typically occur?
- What environmental factors influence how users work?
- What are users trying to accomplish when they hit this problem?
- What happens before and after this problem moment?

### 5. Mental Models & Expectations
- How do users think about this problem?
- What language/terminology do they use?
- What do they expect a solution should do?
- What similar tools or experiences do they reference?

## EXPECTED RESULTS

Produce a comprehensive user research document containing:

1. **User Personas/Segments**
   - 2-4 primary user types with names and descriptions
   - Key characteristics, goals, and contexts for each
   - What makes each segment unique

2. **Current State Journey Map**
   - Step-by-step workflow of how users currently operate
   - Touchpoints, tools, and people involved at each step
   - Time/effort required for each step

3. **Pain Point Inventory**
   - Specific friction points mapped to journey stages
   - Severity and frequency of each pain point
   - Direct user quotes illustrating the pain
   - Current workarounds and their costs

4. **User Context Summary**
   - When/where/why the problem occurs
   - Environmental factors and constraints
   - Dependencies and relationships with other systems/people

5. **Mental Model Documentation**
   - How users think about and describe the problem
   - Key terminology and language patterns
   - User expectations for what "good" looks like
   - Reference points (similar tools/experiences they mention)

6. **Key Insights & Opportunities**
   - Top 3-5 critical insights from the research
   - Potential opportunity areas for solutions
   - Open questions that need more research

## Usage Example

```
Claude, conduct user research using the User Research & Problem Context prompt.
We've validated the problem from the PM interview. Here's what we learned: [summary]
Now help me understand the users deeply.
