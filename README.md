## How to Use

### Conversational Mode (Current)
1. Copy the relevant prompt into Claude Code or Claude
2. Run through the structured questions

4. Feed subsequent prompts with the artifacts from previous ones

### Automated Agent Mode (Future)
These prompts will be adapted for n8n workflow automation with:
- Structured input/output formats
- Human-in-the-loop decision gates
- Automated handoffs between stages

## Agent Workflow

These prompts are designed to work as an autonomous PM agent with human-in-the-loop decision gates:

1. **PM Interview** â†’ Market validation â†’ **[GO/NO-GO decision]**
2. **User Research** â†’ Deep user understanding
3. **Solution Synthesis** â†’ 2-3 solution concepts â†’ **[Choose concept decision]**
4. **Market Analysis** â†’ Competitive positioning (requires web search)
5. **Definition of Done** â†’ Launch criteria
6. **Success Criteria** â†’ Measurement plan with tracking implementation
7. **Functional Requirements** â†’ What the system does
8. **Non-Functional Requirements** â†’ How the system performs (security, performance, compliance)

## Current Status

**âœ… Complete:**
- Product Discovery Phase (4 prompts)
- Requirements Phase (4 prompts)

**ðŸš§ Coming Next:**
- Architecture & Security prompts
- n8n workflow templates
- Structured I/O formats for automation
